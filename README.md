## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- SOA is a procedure that is being used for software development 
that uses software components. It is a service to create business applications. 
It is a technology that helps developers create software.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
* Standardized Service Contract - the service sticks to the service description.
the service have some description that describes about the service that is being
offered.

* Loose Coupling - it lessen the dependency between web services and the clients use
the web service. If service functionality change, it will not stop.

* Service Abstraction - it hides the logic of the software application.

* Service Reusability - logic is being divide into service to maximizing the
reusability of the code, it will help developers not to build the same code once again.

* Service Autonomy - it is the control to the logic that is being hide/encapsulate
but the control to the functionality and the code it contains.

* Service Statelessness - it only menas that software should not hold one state to
other but it should be done by the whole application.

* Service Discoverability - it can be discovered.

* Service Composability - the big problems can be break into small problems.
The execution should be efficiently processing and flexible service contracts
it allows the exhanging requirements for similar functions.

* Service Interoperability - this service use a standards that allows multiple
subcribers to use the service.

3. Define Microservices.
-
The microservice architecture allows an organization to deliver large, 
complicated applications quickly, frequently, accurately, and sustainably.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
* Independently deployable - it is services that is packagable as a executable unit.
By this it can be easily to distribute.

*Right tool for the job - it provides the suitable tools to every component
of an application that shares common stack, database and data model to do
a better tool for the job.

* Precise Scaling - in microservice individual service can be deployed/distribute individually

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The Diffrence of SOA and Microservices-
* Implementation
	-SOA provide different services that shared resources while microservice
	 it provides the independent and smaller services. 
* Data Storage
	-SOA shared data storage, the microservices have independent data storage.

* Deployment 
	-SOA have a challenging distribution/deployment wherein the full rebuild
	 still needs a small changes. The microservices deployment is much easier
         because it is independent.

* Reusability
	-SOA is reusable because of its shared common resources while microservice
	 have its own resources meaning the resources is independent it can be only
         reuse through API's

*Speed
	-SOA have different services this can slow down the speed as more services
	 is added while mircoservices has a consistent speed.

- The Similarities of SOA and Microservices -
* In my perspective the similarities of SOA and Microservice are the services that
it provides for clients. This services had a huge impact for technology to help
the clients achieved their goals and satisfied their ideas.
